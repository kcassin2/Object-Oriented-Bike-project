When we wrote a new piece of code we tested everything to make sure that it worked. First, we made sure that the system admin worked. We were able to login and then create the other users in the program. After we knew that the system admin was done and made sure that the users were being saved, we were able to login as different users in the program. Next, we worked on the Warehouse Manager, we then worked on the Examine parts by name and number, after entering in different parts to test it we always got the right output. After we finished that, we worked on the update Warehouse, this took a lot of time to figure out, but we managed to get it to read in a file and add new parts, but we were not able to update the same part. Then, we worked on the Sales Associate class, we were able to sell a part, the sales associate can enter the part number and then enter the quantity that they want to sell.  We were not able to do the load sales van for the sales associate. Finally, we worked the Office Manager, we were able to do the examine part by name and number, we always got the expected output when we tested this. We get the Order parts to work, it generated parts that were low and then we added more parts that we wanted. The sales invoices for the associate and the customer, and then the sales commission we were not able to figure those out. For our design we mostly kept the main points in our original design, we deleted some classes that we thought we needed. We also changed some code in our classes to make the code be able to work.
